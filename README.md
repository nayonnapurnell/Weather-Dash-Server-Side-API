# Weather-Dash-Server-Side-API

The Horiseon Company has shared that they want to provide weather updates and information to their traveling consulting team.  They have hired me to create a Weather Dashboard for it's consultants to search, view, and save the weather information for the cities that they travel to for project work.

## Project Summary

The following tasks were completed based upon the User Story's acceptance criteria found below:

### User Story

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search     history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
